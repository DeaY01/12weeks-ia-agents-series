Goal: Create next week’s 5 LinkedIn posts about AI agents (including hooks + images).
Agent output:

1. Pull 10 trending AI agent tweets from last 7 days → X/Twitter search
2. Write 5 hooks that beat the top 3 → GPT-4o
3. Turn each into a full 120-word post → Just write
4. Generate one simple image per post (minimalist style) → Midjourney / Flux
5. Schedule them Mon–Fri at 9:00 am → Buffer / LinkedIn scheduler
