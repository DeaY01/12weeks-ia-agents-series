# Week 2 – The 75-Year Secret History of AI Agents

Most people think agents started with Auto-GPT in 2023.  
They’re wrong by **73 years**.

### The One Paper That Predicted Everything (1950)
Claude Shannon – “Programming a Computer for Playing Chess”  
→ First time anyone wrote: a machine that **perceives → decides → acts** on its own.

### Full Timeline (1950–2025) – You’ll Sound Like a Professor
1950 – Shannon: “machines that act without human moves”  
1956 – Newell & Simon: Logic Theorist (first “thinking” program)  
1966 – Shakey the Robot (Stanford) – first real agent that moved & planned  
1987 – Brooks: “Intelligence without representation” (reactive agents)  
1997 – Deep Blue beats Kasparov → goal-driven agent  
2017 – AlphaGo Zero → learns from scratch  
2023 – Auto-GPT & BabyAGI → open-source explosion  
2025 – You and I are here building them in Nigeria
